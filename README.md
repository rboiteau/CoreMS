# CoreMS

**CoreMS** is a comprehensive mass spectrometry framework for software development and data analysis of small molecules analysis.

Data handling and software development for modern mass spectrometry (MS) is an interdisciplinary endeavor requiring skills in computational science and a deep understanding of MS. To enable scientific software development to keep pace with fast improvements in MS technology, we have developed a Python software framework named CoreMS. The goal of the framework is to provide a fundamental, high-level basis for working with all mass spectrometry data types, allowing custom workflows for data signal processing, annotation, and curation. The data structures were designed with an intuitive, mass spectrometric hierarchical structure, thus allowing organized and easy access to the data and calculations. Moreover, CoreMS supports direct access for almost all vendorsâ€™ data formats, allowing for the centralization and automation of all data processing workflows from the raw signal to data annotation and curation.

- reproducible pipeline
- logical mass spectrometric data structure
- self-containing data and metadata storage
- modern molecular formulae assignment algorithms
- dynamic molecular search space database search and generator

## CoreMS Installation
    
```bash
pip install corems
```

A external database is needed to run the molecular formula assignments workflow:  
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
-  Database url = "postgres://coremsdb:coremsmolform@localhost:5432/molformula"  
    The database url is already set the default on the CoreMS parameter model class

To be able to open thermo file a installation of pythonnet is needed:
- Windows: 
    ```bash
    pip install pythonnet
    ```

- Mac and Linux:
    ```bash
    brew install mono
    pip install pythonnet   
    ```
 Another option is to run the docker stack that will start the CoreMS containers(see next section)

## Molecular Database and Jupyter Notebook

A docker container containing:
- A custom python distribution will all dependencies installed
- A Jupyter notebook server with workflow examples
- A PostgreSQL database for the molecular formulae assignment

If you don't have docker installed, the easiest way is to [install docker for desktop](https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding)

- Start the containers from the latest built docker image (easiest way): 

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-jupyter.yml up
    ```

- Build a new image with current changes: 

    1) Build the corems image:
        ```bash
        docker build -t corems:local .
        ```
    2. Start the database container:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d   
        ```
    3. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
        ```bash
        docker run --rm -v ./data:/home/CoreMS/data corems:local
        ```

- Open your browser, copy and past the URL address provided in the terminal: `http://localhost:8888/?token=<token>.`

- Open the CoreMS-Tutorial.ipynb
